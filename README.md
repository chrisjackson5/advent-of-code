# :christmas_tree: Advent of Code :christmas_tree:
>*"Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a 
variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming 
language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, 
university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each 
other."*

This repo contains my attempts at the annual [Advent of Code](adventofcode.com) 
challenges.

I use a different language for each year's solutions, which you can browse 
below.
